# Kiss Anime App
----------------
A better way to view kissanime videos/clips/episodes  
It features a 3 by 3 grid layout with each cell containing a video card.  
Each card in turn contains the video and other video information such as the episode, season and episode title as well as the series title.

4. `pip create/generate flask-company` or `pip create/generate flask-personal`
5. *`pip create/generate writer` or `pip create/generate developer`*
